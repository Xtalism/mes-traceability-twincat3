# twincatTraceability
HTTP requests template for treaceability and IoT applications using Twincat 3 and structured text.

I'm a Twincat 3 beginner myself, when I started programming I realized that the documentation provided by Beckhoff isn't enough,
don't get me wrong, Beckhoff's documentation is really good, you're going to find everything you need there, the problem I
have is that Twincat's forums are not as helpful as StackOverflow is when it comes in terms of Software Developing.

Software developers share their code and problems so other developers sharing the same problem in the future can figure out their problem
creating a "community documentation" where you can solve your problem using code from others, taking their code and improving
it, and so on. Such thing doesn't happen in the PLC community where they think code shouldn't be shared because "it's going to be stolen"
or because you just don't know how to code. A lot of talented coders see another code to improve their code or just to understand the 
thing they're dealing with.

Another harsh part about PLC or Automatization community is that, they don´t tend to use repositories, at least here in the American Continent, they make Back-Ups in their cloud services or saving their programs in their Hard Drives. Their version control is outrageous.

I'll try to do this as understandable as possible, and I´m not an expert in this. I'm a Mechatronics engineer but I'm specialized in the Software
Branch of it, I'm more related to Software Engineering than Automatization, if that makes any sense.
