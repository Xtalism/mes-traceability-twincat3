# TwinCAT 3 Traceability and IoT HTTP Requests

This repository contains a template and examples for handling HTTP requests in **TwinCAT 3**, specifically designed for **traceability** and **IoT applications**. As a beginner in TwinCAT 3, 
I created this resource to share what Iâ€™ve learned, providing others with the kind of help I wish I had when I started.

## Why This Repository?

While Beckhoff provides excellent documentation for TwinCAT 3, it often lacks the kind of community-driven support that developers are accustomed to in broader software engineering fields. This 
repository aims to fill that gap by:

- Offering a reusable HTTP request template for traceability and IoT applications.
- Encouraging collaboration and code sharing within the PLC community.
- Promoting best practices, such as using version control and community documentation.

## Challenges in the PLC Community

1. **Lack of Code Sharing**  
   In the PLC world, sharing code is often discouraged due to concerns over intellectual property. This limits collaboration and innovation. In contrast, software developers rely on shared examples to learn and improve.

2. **Outdated Version Control Practices**  
   Many automation professionals still rely on cloud backups or local storage instead of modern version control systems like Git. This repository serves as an example of how version control can benefit PLC programming.

3. **Limited Community Documentation**  
   Unlike the software development community, where shared knowledge often evolves into unofficial documentation, the automation field lacks accessible resources for newcomers.

## Resources

There are many resources out there in different platforms, what I like the most was [Kajob Sagatowski's](https://www.youtube.com/@JakobSagatowski) TwinCAT 3 video series and his [AllTwinCAT](https://alltwincat.com/twincat-3-tutorial/) 
website. Feel free to explore more!
